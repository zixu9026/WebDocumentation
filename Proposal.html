			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>The Great Barrier Reef is one of Australia's most remarkable natural gifts. There are thousands of species of marine life and 3000 individual reefs. The Great Barrier Reef is one of the world's most famous tourist destination because of its natural beauty. It has colossal economic, social and heritage value. However, in these years global warming, overfishing, marine pollution and many other threats are affecting the biological and environment of the Great Barrier Reef. It has lost more than half of its corals since 1995 due to the climate change (BBC News, 2020). The Great Barrier Reef Foundation website is an invitation to all the tourists and visitors of the website, the users can take action or donate to help saving the special ecosystem in Australia. </p>

      <h4>The Need</h4>
			<p>For the charity website, the main purpose was provide clear activities and projects they are doing to encourage users to get involved. It need to consider different user needs and requirements for different types of users, such as: individual donors, volunteers and visitors. In the Great Barrier Reef Foundation website, creating and distributing valuable content such as maps, introduction of species and current threats can help the users to get deeper understanding of why they should join the community and help to save the ecosystem. However, the website should not only demonstrating informations, activities can help users to interact with the website and get better digital experience. The website will also be a platform that users can share their own experiences of donating, volunteering or even visiting. These recorded experiences will give a progress that users can review  and get a sense of achievement that participating the program. </p>
			<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
			<p>Because the Great Barrier Reef is 1 of 7 natural wonders of the world that lots of tourists have visited or willing to visit it. It is important to take strategies to save the environment. The target users for the Great Barrier Reef Foundation website will be people likes natural beauty, especially tourists been to the Great Barrier Reef or Australian residents that want to look after the unique ecosystem. </p>
      <p>In the design and iteration process, I focused on developing two main user groups user profile to explore their stories and journeys: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Australia residents that are proud of the Great Barrier Reef. </li>
        <figure>

        </figure>
        <blockquote>
				The Reef is an irreplaceable global icon. As Australians, we should be proud that it's our responsibility to look after it.    -- The Great Barrier Reef Foundation
			  </blockquote>
        <li>International tourists been to the Great Barrier Reef or want to visit it. </li>

			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>My design concept was not only giving informations about the Great Barrier Reef in the website. But create a map activities that users can interact with to make the protecting ecosystem process more interesting. Because there are lots of tourists around the world visiting the Great Barrier Reef, There will be a world map in the website. Every user can post their experience of the Great Barrier Reef or why they want to visit there. The map will display statistics of donation, where are the reef protecting projects located, show its progress and where are the helpers come from. These are the main information will provided in the Great Barrier Reef Foundation website: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Informations about the ecosystem & unique species </li>
				<li>Projects that the charity is doing & progress </li>
				<li>Map activities & user community to share experience </li>
        <li>Donate and volunteer program</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="Moodboard.png" alt="Moodboard"/>
        <figcaption>Moodboard</figcaption>
      </figure>
			<p>Because the Great Barrier Reef is mostly about the ocean. I choose to use more cold colours in my design. Dark blues represented the secret in oceans. The bright colours will use to highlight some specific user interactions and attract users attention. Images will use a lot in the website to display the natural beauty of the Great Barrier Reef. This can help users to rethink the importance of protecting this unique ecosystem. </p>

      <h4>Landing Page</h4>
      <figure>
				<img src="Sketch1.png" alt="sketch"/>
				<figcaption>Sketch 1 </figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The first iteration of the landing page was show the current news of the Foundation. When user firstly come to the website, they can see the updated informations about the projects. This can give users feeling that the Foundation is trustable that showing the progress of projects. It can be an invitation that users can participate in donating or volunteering. The menu bar on the left side displays all the sub pages' title. I thought it may help users to find the information clearly. But there are too much information that users hard to see. So I decided only show the 4 main stages of website on the top bar in the second iteration. </p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Sketch2.png" alt="sketch"/>
        <figcaption>Sketch 2</figcaption>

      <h3 id="sitemap">Site map</h3>
      <p>The site map displays how the Great Barrier Reef Foundation website’s layout will work. There are 4 choices under the home page that users can follow through. Each of them have different purpose. The About page will give users a brief introduction of the Great Barrier Reef. Projects page is the second stage that users can learn what the charity is doing and clearly understand the current progress through the sub pages. The more clear informations users get, they will more interested to moving to the third stage: Get involved. This is the page different user group will take different actions. There are choices for users to participate. The Account page will be all about users, they can share their stories and give feedback about the program. Reading other users experiences can help to attract visitors of the website to join this community and get involved. </p>

			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
      <p>This is the home page of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation website. I decided to keep the 4 stages in the top from sketch 2 and explore current news from sketch 1. This can be an introduction page for users to get various information: the natural beauty, species and current threats. The user can ‘like’ the articles that they can come back and review them. The footer area will be a signup section that users can enter their emails and get more information about the website. </p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Wireframe1.png" alt="landing page"/>
        <figcaption>Landing Page</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This wireframe is for the About page. The top bar will be the same. However, I decided to put more images at this stage that users can flip through. The top part will look like an image gallery. I choose rounded images to demonstrate the different species in the Great Barrier Reef. It looks more tidy and users can click their name to get more information. </p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Wireframe2.png" alt="Information page"/>
        <figcaption>Animal information page</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>For the Projects page, I think the most important thing users want to see is the progress. So for each of the projects, I added a progress bar under the project overview. The users will able to see either the donation progress or the technical process's progress. There will also be a Donation button after each of the project as a reminder and invitation to the users. </p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Wireframe3.png" alt="Information page"/>
        <figcaption>Project information page</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The world map activity page is a page that users can interact with. When they click on the map, there will show other user’s story, the donation progress or the project overview depends with part of map they are clicking. It's more like a community pages that users can share their experiences also get information about projects the Foundation is doing. I think the map is more visual way that users can get various information about the projects. </p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Wireframe4.png" alt="activity"/>
        <figcaption>Map activity page</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The Donate page requires user input their information. There will be a form collecting their data. The circles in the right side is where users can choose to donate different amounts. If they didn't signup in the early steps, they can access to signup in this page too. The image will display on top to demonstrate if no action taken, what the Great Barrier Reef will look like. This is a warning to the users and encourage them to get involved. </p>
      <figure>

      <h3 id="mockups">Mockups</h3>
      <p>The mock ups demonstrate higher quality prototype. For the landing page, the images added can attract the users attention while they first enter the website. Updated news were used to give them more informations about what the website are doing and how the protecting reef process works. The colour blue was used to emphasise the ocean. </p>
      <figure>
				<img src="Mockup1.png" alt="landing page"/>
        <figcaption>Landing Page</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <P>Users can scroll through the image gallery to see the different species living in the Great Barrier Reef. This is an emphasis that the ecosystem is unique and we need to protect it. The users can access to their user profile, home page, about page, donate page at anytime. Also in the footer part, they can enter their email to get more information and join the community. </P>
      <figure>
				<img src="Mockup2.png" alt="Information page"/>
        <figcaption>Animal information page</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The progress bar showed the process of each projects. Users are interest in how they can participate in the protecting reef program. They need to see how their donation can impact the reef. The progress bar is a visual way to explore the timing passed. Users can get a sense of achievement and feeling participated of the program. This can help them to explore their ideas and share their stories. </p>
      <figure>

      <p>These two final mockups are users can interact with. They can interact with the map to see other user stories and explore their own experiences. When they scroll down the donate page, they can get access to fill out a form to participate the donation. Images were used to emphasise the importance of protecting reef in a visual way.  </p>
